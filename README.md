# RTL-to-GDSII
Here, we will look in RTL to GDSII flow tool OpenLane and will try to implement whole flow on our design to get a clean layout. 

Overview
OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII - this capability will be released in the coming weeks with completed SoC design examples that have been sent to SkyWater for fabrication.
